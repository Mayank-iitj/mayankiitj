# 🌌 Mayank Sharma — Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, built as a refined replica of the Cosmos-style portfolio layout with my own custom tweaks, animations, and content. It serves as a central hub for my work in AI/ML, data engineering, cybersecurity, and full‑stack development. [page:1]

🔗 **Live site:** https://mayankiit.in/ [page:1]

## ✨ Features

- **Cosmos-inspired layout** with clean typography and minimal, dark-themed aesthetics. [page:1]
- **Fully responsive** design for desktop, tablet, and mobile using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. [page:1]
- **Smooth scrolling & navigation** with distinct sections for About, Skills, Projects, and Contact. (implemented in `index.html` and `script.js`) [page:1]
- **One‑click resume download** directly from the navbar. (see `resume-ms.pdf`) [page:1]
- **Optimized for deployment** on Vercel with a dedicated `vercel.json` configuration. [page:1]
- **Basic SEO setup** including `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` configured for `mayankiit.in`. [page:1]

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository and open it locally:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Mayank-iitj/mayankiitj.git
cd mayankiitj
You can directly open index.html in your browser or use a lightweight local server:

bash
# Using Python
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Visit: http://localhost:8000
No build step is required since this is a static site.

🌱 Roadmap / Ideas
Add project detail pages for major AI/ML and data engineering work.

Integrate a blog section for write‑ups on hackathons, research, and security findings.

Add dark/light theme toggle with local storage.

Improve accessibility and add more semantic HTML elements.

Hook basic analytics to understand traffic and engagement.
